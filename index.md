## The motive

I want to monitor my home network with Wazuh and Suricata working together, and I want an easy way to see the alerts that are generated by Wazuh.
I could use the Wazuh integrations that are ready, like [Slack](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/proof-of-concept-guide/poc-integrate-slack.html), but Discord is a tool that I use daily and is perfect to use as an example on how to build a custom integration with Wazuh.
it is possible to create a custom-integration to send alerts to practically any place that has a webhook or any other form of receiving data via POST requests. Like Teams for example.


I'm assuming that you already have Wazuh instaled and working, in this setup i'm working with a "All in one" installation in my kali vm, you can follow with any Linux distribution you like. If you are working with Wazuh distribud in nodes, you will have to configure the integration on all the node managers too.

### Creating a webhook

The first thing to do is create a discord webhhok on **your** server chat
```markdown
- Open your server settings
- On "Integrations", click on "webhooks" to generate one
- Save the webhook link for now
```
Enter in the integrations folder of Wazuh. 
```markdown
cd /var/ossec/integrations 
```
![](/docs/assets/images/01.png)

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/egn-egn/egn-egn.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
